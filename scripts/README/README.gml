	"Memory Match Game" is a working prototype. It sure lacks polishing, which I may or may not do in the future.
	All graphics assets are very simple and they are "placeholders". You may replace them with your artwork if you 
	wish so. To replace the cards artwork, simply replace the frames of the spr_card. The code is fully commented
	and I believe it is easy to be grasped. You can change the code as you see fit. 

	This is my very first GameMaker Studio 2 project, so any feedback, recomentations are welcome, especially if it
	is going to make me better with GMS2!

	The "flipping" of the cards is animated, so that gives a little bit of something more, compared to a simple sprite 
	change. The "flipping" animation is simply the sprite's x scale manipulation is a way that gives the illusion of 3d. 
	This simple technique is based on a video from "The Step Event" YouTube Channel and can be found here:

	No attribution or credit is required, but I'd love to see your game that might come from this project.
	You could tweet me at @GeorgeHarpwood and show me your work if you feel like it...
